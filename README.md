# DSA Learning By Shaggy 
 
Welcome to my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository contains various algorithms and data structures implemented in C++.

## Directories
1. Algorithms
   [Searching] (https://github.com/Shaheer-Shaggy/DSA/tree/main/Algorithm/Searching) ,
   [Sorting] (https://github.com/Shaheer-Shaggy/DSA/tree/main/Algorithm/Sorting)

2. Data Structures
   [Linked_Lists] (https://github.com/Shaheer-Shaggy/DSA/tree/main/Link%20list)


## Usage 

To run these files, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory of the file you want to run

```bash 
 cd {path_to_the_file}
```
for example:
```bash
 cd Algorithm\Sorting 
 ```
 2. Compile the file using the following command

 ```
  g++ {filename} -o main.exe
 ```
 Replace {filename} with the actual name of your C++ file.

 3. Run the executable file through the file explorer or by using the terminal
 ```
 ./main.exe
 ```
